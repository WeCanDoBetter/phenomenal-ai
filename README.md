**Phenomenal AI** is a TypeScript package for building a turn-based
conversational prompt generator for large language models. This package provides
the building blocks for simulating conversational interactions between multiple
entities, referred to as actors. Actors can share information, engage in
dialogue, and dynamically adjust the course of conversation based on predefined
rules.

## üìå Features

- üé≠ **Multiple Actors**: This package supports interaction between multiple
  actors, allowing for complex conversational scenarios. Each actor can have
  their own personality and preferences.
- üìö **Conversation History**: Every conversation has a history which tracks the
  course of dialogue over time. The history is used to generate responses to new
  lines of dialogue.
- üíæ **Shared Context**: Actors in a conversation share a context that allows
  them to store and retrieve information relevant to the ongoing discussion. The
  context can be used to store information such as the topic of conversation,
  the location, the time of day, etc.
- üîÑ **Scheduling**: The package provides a mechanism to decide the order of
  turns between the actors using schedulers. The package comes with a default
  scheduler that schedules turns in a round-robin fashion.
- üé¨ **Conversation Turn Management**: Controls the turn flow of the
  conversation and provides a method to inject new messages into the
  conversation. The package also provides a method to query the conversation
  with a question and get a response.
- üìú **Context Window Management**: The package provides a mechanism to manage
  the context window. The context window is the number of tokens to unmask in
  the history when generating a response. This allows you to control the prompt
  size and the amount of context provided to the model.
- ‚ú® **High-Level Abstraction**: Phenomenal AI provides a high level of
  abstraction for AI-based conversation models. This allows you to focus on the
  conversation logic and not the underlying model.
- üìù **TypeScript**: The package is written in TypeScript and provides type
  definitions.
- üì¶ **Lightweight**: The package has only one external dependency (`mustache`),
  making it lightweight and easy to use.
- üß™ **Extensible**: The package is designed to be extensible. You can provide
  your own text generation function, scheduler, etc.

## üèÅ Getting Started

You can install the package via npm:

```bash
npm install @wecandobetter/phenomenal-ai
```

Or via yarn:

```bash
yarn add @wecandobetter/phenomenal-ai
```

## üöÄ Usage Examples

The `Conversation` class encapsulates all actors and manages the history,
context and the scheduling of actor's turns. The `Actor` class represents an
actor in the conversation.

The following example shows how to use the `Conversation` class to simulate a
conversation between two actors.

```typescript
import { Actor, Conversation } from "@wecandobetter/phenomenal-ai";
import { generateText } from "./text-generation"; // provide your own text generation function

// Define your actors
let actors: Actor[] = [
  new Actor("John"),
  new Actor("Emma"),
];

// Initialize a conversation
const conversation = new Conversation("Morning Talk", { actors });

// Add a context entry
conversation.context.set("topic", "Current topic of conversation", "AI Ethics");

// Make a query:

const response = await conversation.query({
  speaker: actors[0], // the speaker, i.e. the actor asking the question
  answerer: actors[1], // the answerer, i.e. the actor answering the question
  query: "What is the topic of conversation?", // the query to be answered
  generateText, // provide your own text generation function
  store: true, // store the response in the history
});

console.log(`${response.speaker}: ${response.text}`);

// Moderate the conversation by injecting a new message:

conversation.inject("Let's get back to the topic of conversation.", {
  speaker: "Moderator", // the speaker of the message (defaults to `System`)
  ephemeral: true, // this message will not be stored in the history
});

// Make one turn:

const turn = await conversation.turn({
  actor: conversation.scheduler.getNextSpeaker(), // get the next speaker from the scheduler
  generateText, // provide your own text generation function
});

console.log(`${turn.speaker}: ${turn.text}`);

// or use an async generator:

const ac = new AbortController();

const loop = conversation.loop({
  signal: ac.signal, // provide an AbortSignal to stop the loop
  generateText, // provide your own text generation function
  scheduler: conversation.scheduler, // provide your own scheduler
});

for await (const turn of loop) {
  console.log(`${turn.speaker}: ${turn.text}`);
}
```

## üìö API Reference

The main classes of this package are `Conversation`, `ConversationHistory`, and
`Actor`.

### Conversation

The `Conversation` class represents an ongoing conversation between multiple
actors.

#### Properties

- `id`: Unique identifier for the conversation.
- `name`: Name of the conversation.
- `actors`: Array of `Actor`s participating in the conversation.
- `history`: The history of the conversation.
- `context`: Shared context between all actors in the conversation.

#### Methods

These are the methods available on the `Conversation` class.

##### `new Conversation(name: string, { actors: Actor[], generateText?: GenerateText, scheduler?: Scheduler, messages?: Message[], windowss?: { history?: number } })`

Initializes a new instance of the `Conversation` class.

```typescript
const conversation = new Conversation("Morning Talk", {
  actors: [
    new Actor("John"),
    new Actor("Emma"),
  ],
  generateText: generateText, // provide your own text generation function
  scheduler: IndexScheduler, // provide your own scheduler
  messages: [], // bootstrap the conversation with messages
  windows: { // configure the conversation window
    history: 1024, // the maximum number of tokens to unmask in the history
  },
});
```

##### `conversation.inject(text: string, { speaker = "System" embeddings?: number[], ephemeral?: true })`

Injects a new message into the conversation. Returns the injected message.

```typescript
const message = conversation.inject(
  "Let's get back to the topic of conversation.",
  {
    speaker: "Moderator",
    ephemeral: true, // if true, the message will not be stored in the history after the next turn
  },
);
```

##### `conversation.query({ speaker: Actor, answerer: Actor, query: string, generateText?: GenerateText, store = false })`

Returns a promise that resolves to a turn response.

```typescript
const response = await conversation.query({
  speaker: actors[0], // the speaker, i.e. the actor asking the question
  answerer: actors[1], // the answerer, i.e. the actor answering the question
  query: "What is the topic of conversation?", // the query to be answered
  generateText, // provide your own text generation function
  store: true, // store the response in the history
});

console.log(`${response.speaker}: ${response.text}`);
```

##### `conversation.turn({ actor: Actor, generateText?: GenerateText })`

Returns a promise that resolves to a turn response.

```typescript
const response = await conversation.turn({
